Tic-Tac-Toe is a basic two-player game in which players take turns putting their marks ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to have three of one's marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

The task of this problem is to simulate a Tic-Tac-Toe game in which one of the players is served by a machine learning agent (AI) learning to play perfectly using Q-learning, and the other player being a human. The AI has to make a choice based on what it learned, while the user plays through giving their actions.
